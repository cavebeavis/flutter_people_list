## Flutter Application Example

The following repo is for a simple one page flutter app example. The actual flutter code is in `flutter_app/` folder.

This is meant to be deployed in Firebase and therefore the `public/` folder is the built code from `flutter_app/`. The `functions/` is a placeholder for creating the json api endpoint which populates this app.
